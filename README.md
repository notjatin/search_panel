The panel fetches country, states and cities with the help of an API. The API docs are [here](https://countrystatecity.in/docs).

### How to make it work
* Request an API key from the above link.
* Place the key inside the `.env_sample` file like this `API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"`.
* Rename `.env_sample` to `.env`.
